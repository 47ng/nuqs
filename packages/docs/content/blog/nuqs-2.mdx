nuqs@2.0.0 is available, try it now:

```npm
npm install nuqs@latest
```

It's packing exciting features & improvements, including:

- [Support for other React frameworks](#hello-react): Next.js, React SPA, Remix, React Router, and more to come
- A built-in [testing adapter](#testing) to unit-test your components in isolation
- [Bundle size improvements](#bundle-size-improvements)
- Interactive documentation, with [community parsers](/docs/parsers/community)

## Hello, React! üëã ‚öõÔ∏è [#hello-react]

nuqs started as a Next.js-only hook, and v2 brings compatibility for other React frameworks:

- Next.js 14 & 15 (app & pages routers)
- React SPA
- Remix
- React Router

No code change is necessary in components that use nuqs hooks,
making them **universal** across all supported frameworks.

The only new requirement is to wrap your React tree with an
[adapter](/docs/adapters) for your framework.

Example for a React SPA with Vite:

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
// [!code word:NuqsAdapter]
import { NuqsAdapter } from 'nuqs/adapters/react'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <NuqsAdapter>
    <App />
  </NuqsAdapter>
)
```

<Callout>
  The [adapters documentation](/docs/adapters) has examples for all supported
  frameworks.
</Callout>

## Testing

One of the major pain points with nuqs v1 was testing components that used its hooks.

Nuqs v2 comes with a built-in [testing adapter](/docs/testing) that mocks URL behaviours,
allowing you to test your components in isolation, outside of any framework runtime.

You can use it with any unit testing framework that renders React components
(I recommend [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) & [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)).

```tsx title="counter-button.test.tsx"
// [!code word:NuqsTestingAdapter]
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { NuqsTestingAdapter, type UrlUpdateEvent } from 'nuqs/adapters/testing'
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import { CounterButton } from './counter-button'

it('should increment the count when clicked', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  const onUrlUpdate = vi.fn<[UrlUpdateEvent]>()
  render(<CounterButton />, {
    // 1. Setup the test by passing initial search params / querystring:
    wrapper: ({ children }) => (
      <NuqsTestingAdapter searchParams="?count=42" onUrlUpdate={onUrlUpdate}>
        {children}
      </NuqsTestingAdapter>
    )
  })
  // 2. Act
  const button = screen.getByRole('button')
  await user.click(button)
  // 3. Assert changes in the state and in the (mocked) URL
  expect(button).toHaveTextContent('count is 43')
  expect(onUrlUpdate).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].queryString).toBe('?count=43')
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].searchParams.get('count')).toBe('43')
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].options.history).toBe('push')
})
```

The adapter conforms to the **setup** / **act** / **assert** testing strategy, allowing you
to:

1. Set the initial URL search params
2. Let your test framework perform actions on your component
3. Asserting on how the URL was changed as a result

## Breaking changes & migration

The biggest breaking change is the introduction of [adapters](/docs/adapters).
Another one is related to deprecated APIs.

The `next-usequerystate` package that started this journey is no longer updated.
All updates are now published under the `nuqs` package name.

The minimum version of Next.js supported is now 14.2.0. It is compatible with
Next.js 15, including the async `searchParams{:ts}` page prop in the [server-side cache](/docs/server-side).

There are some important behaviour changes, based on feedback from the community:

- [`clearOnDefault{:ts}`](/docs/options#clear-on-default) is now `true{:ts}` by default
- [`startTransition{:ts}`](/docs/options#transitions) no longer sets `shallow: false{:ts}`
- [`parseAsJson{:ts}`](/docs/parsers/built-in#json) now requires a validation function

<Callout>
  Read the complete [migration guide](/docs/migrations/v2) to update your
  applications.
</Callout>

## Bundle size improvements

By moving to **ESM-only**, and dropping hacks needed to support older versions of Next.js,
the bundle size is now **20% smaller** than v1. It's also **side-effects free** and **tree-shakable**.

## What's next?

The community and I have a lot of ideas for the future of nuqs, including:

- A unified, scalable, type-safe routing experience in all supported React frameworks
- Community-contributed parsers & adapters
- New options: debouncing, global defaults override
- Middleware to migrate old URLs to new ones
- Better Zod integration for type-safe & runtime-safe validation
