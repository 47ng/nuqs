The nuqs tagline, _"type-safe search params state manager for React"_, only represents
a small fraction of what nuqs does under the hood. Type-safety is only the tip of the iceberg,
and there are dangers hidden under the water line that you (or better, your tools) need to be aware of.

## Read vs Write

One of the first things people do when they want type-safe URL state is to
bring in validation libraries (Zod, Valibot, ArkType, anything Standard Schema)
to parse `URLSearchParams{:ts}` into valid data types they can use in their apps.

That's **read** type-safety, and it is fairly easy to achieve.

You could stop here and wonder why you'd need another third party library, until
you need to **write** search params with _complex_ state. Anything that doesn't
trivially stringify using `.toString(){:ts}` will need a _serialisation_ step that matches
the parsing <small>(math nerds call this property _bijectivity_)</small>.

Validation libraries don't provide the reverse transform from an object or data type
back to the string it got transformed from. To address this, nuqs comes with [built-in parsers](/docs/parsers/built-in)
for common data types, but you can also [make your own](docs/parsers/making-your-own)
to give your complex data types a beautiful, **compact** representation in the URL
<small>(because URL-encoded JSON is verbose and rather ugly)</small>.

Compacity here is the important property: URLs have a size limit, much like local storage
or cookies.

While 2000 characters is safe, the HTTP spec allows a bit more headroom at 8KB, but
practical limitations will be those of the medium you share your URL through, and
the (un)willingness of users to click very long links. Remember:

> The URL is the first piece of UI your users will see. Design it as such.

<Callout title="Tip: what state goes in the URL?">
  Only store state in the URL that you want to **share with others** (including your future self, with bookmarks
  and history navigation).

  Putting state there only because it's convenient for it to persist across page reloads will likely
  make you overuse this pattern.
</Callout>

## Deserialise, parse, validate

Validation libraries still have a very important purpose: making sure your state is
**runtime-safe**. Even after deserialisation into the correct data type,
there may be invalid _values_ you want to avoid, and that you cannot represent with
static typing alone. Things like:

- A number between -90/+90 or -180/+180 for latitude/longitude coordinates
- A string formatted in a certain way (eg: email, UUID)
- A date greater than a given epoch

On read, validation should occur **after** deserialisation, on a data type relatively close
to the desired output (which is ensured by parsing).

Similarly, on write, validation should occur **before** serialisation, to
make sure invalid states don't get persisted to the URL.


## Time Safety

80% of the nuqs codebase does not deal with _type safety_, but **time safety**.

One of the lesser known issues with the
[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API)
(that most routers use to update the URL without doing a full page load) is that
**browsers rate-limit URL updates**, for security reasons.

Calling updates too quickly will throw an error, potentially crashing your app
in the process.

Not all browsers are equal on this rate limiting: Chrome and Firefox allow about 50ms between calls
to be safe, but Safari has much higher limits, and requires about 120ms between calls.

This issue surfaces when binding URL state to a high-frequency input, like a text box
`<input type="text">{:html}` or a slider `<input type="range">{:html}`.

You could solve this by keeping inputs _uncontrolled_ and deferring the URL update to
a later time (after a debounce timeout or the press of a button), but controlled inputs have their
purpose. If you want to follow external URL updates to reset their state, or if other
parts of the React tree need this state, call `useQueryState(s){:ts}` anywhere you need
access to that shared state (the same way you would use a global state manager like Zustand, Jotai etc.),
and nuqs will **lift the state _out_** into the URL for you.

Rather than requiring rigidity in userland, nuqs embraces browser limits and solves the time safety
problem with a **throttled queue** and **optimistic URL updates**.

This also allows **batching** state updates from different sources, and **stitching** them together
automatically, which is one of the most encountered pain points when doing this manually.

```ts
const [lat, setLat] = useQueryState('lat', parseAsFloat)
const [lng, setLng] = useQueryState('lng', parseAsFloat)

const randomCoordinates = () => {
  // These will be batched into a single URL update
  setLat(Math.random() * 180 - 90)
  setLng(Math.random() * 360 - 180)
}
```

<Callout>
  You might want to use [`useQueryStates{:ts}`](/docs/batching) for better type-safety when using
  related states.
</Callout>

The upcoming [debounce feature](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs/pull/900) makes this process
even more apparent, with the additionnal complexity of having to handle aborting pending updates
when the user navigates away from the page they're on, to avoid stale state updates being
applied on the wrong pathname or overriding link state (last user action wins).

## Immutability

Once you've shared URLs out in the wild, they become **immutable**.

But your application is anything but immutable. The statefulness you introduce by adding
URL state makes it akin to a database schema. Each shared URL is an immutable database
snapshot that your app needs to be able to process throughout its lifetime, to honor the promise
encoded in those links. But it should not prevent you from making changes in the expected
schema your app accepts.

Just like database schemas, we can handle this with **migrations**:

1. Capture old URLs with a middleware
2. Migrate the old state schema into what the app currently expects
3. Redirect to the updated URL to continue

We've [explored declarative ways](https://x.com/fortysevenfx/status/1842162844613112081) to do this,
but this is something that could benefit more than nuqs users, so it may materialise
as a complementary package.

```ts
// Note: this is a hypothetical API.

const applyMigrations = createURLMigration([
  {
    // Transform /?hello=world to /?name=world
    type: "rename-key",
    from: "hello",
    to: "name",
  },
  {
    // Transform /?hello=world&bye-bye=gone to /?hello=world
    type: "remove-key",
    key: "bye-bye",
  },
  {
    // Convert /?date=2022-01-01T00:00:00Z to /?date=1640995200000
    type: "update-value",
    key: "date",
    action: (value) => {
      const date = parseAsIsoDateTime.parse(value);
      if (date === null) {
        return null;
      }
      return parseAsTimestamp.serialize(date);
    },
  },
  {
    type: "custom", // Full control (with great power…)
    action: (request) => {
      const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(request.nextUrl.searchParams);
      const value = parseAsFoo.parse(searchParams.get('foo'))
      searchParams.delete('foo')
      searchParams.set('bar', parseAsBar.serialize(value))
      return { applied: true, searchParams }
    },
  },
]);

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const result = applyMigrations(request);
  if (result.applied) {
    return result.response;
  }
  return NextReponse.next();
}
```

## Conclusion

Achieving type-safety for URL state is not the endgame: there are other things
that URL state management libraries need to deal with to provide truly
safe and durable state management.
