description: Configuring nuqs
---

By default, `nuqs` will update search params:
1. On the client only (not sending requests to the server),
2. by replacing the current history entry,
3. and without scrolling to the top of the page.

These behaviours can be configured, along with a few additional options.


## Passing options

Options can be passed at the hook level via the builder pattern:

```ts
// [!code word:withOptions]
const [state, setState] = useQueryState(
  'foo',
  parseAsString.withOptions({ history: 'push' })
)
```

Or when calling the state updater function, as a second parameter:

```ts
// [!code word:scroll]
setState('foo', { scroll: true })
```

Call-level options will override hook level options.

### Global defaults override

<FeatureSupportMatrix introducedInVersion='2.5.0' />

Default values for some options can also be configured globally via the `defaultOptions{:ts}`
[adapter](/docs/adapters) prop:

```tsx
// [!code word:defaultOptions]
<NuqsAdapter
  defaultOptions={{
    shallow: false,
    scroll: true,
    clearOnDefault: false,
    limitUrlUpdates: throttle(250),
  }}
>
  {children}
</NuqsAdapter>
```

## History

By default, state updates are done by **replacing** the current history entry with
the updated query when state changes.

You can see this as a sort of `git squash{:shell}`, where all state-changing
operations are merged into a single browsing history entry.

You can also opt-in to **push** a new history entry for each state change,
per key, which will let you use the Back button to navigate state
updates:

```ts
// Append state changes to history:
// [!code word:history]
useQueryState('foo', { history: 'push' })
```

<Callout title="Watch out!" type="warn">
Breaking the Back button can lead to a bad user experience. Make sure to use this
option only if the search params to update contribute to a navigation-like
experience (eg: tabs, modals). Overriding the Back behaviour must be a UX
enhancement rather than a nuisance.

_-- "With great power comes great responsibility."_
</Callout>

## Shallow

By default, query state updates are done in a _client-first_ manner: there are
no network calls to the server.

This is equivalent to the `shallow` option of the Next.js router set to `true{:ts}`.

To opt-in to notifying the server on query updates, you can set `shallow` to `false{:ts}`:

```ts
// [!code word:shallow]
useQueryState('foo', { shallow: false })
```

Note that the shallow option only makes sense if your page can be server-side rendered.
Therefore, it has no effect in React SPA.

For server-side renderable frameworks, you would pair `shallow: false{:ts}` with:

- In Next.js app router: the `searchParams` page prop to render the RSC tree based on the updated query state.
- In Next.js pages router: the `getServerSideProps` function
- In Remix & React Router: a `loader` function

### In React Router based frameworks

While the `shallow: true{:ts}` default behaviour is uncommon for Remix and React Router,
where loaders are always supposed to run on URL changes, nuqs gives you control
of this behaviour, by opting in to running loaders only if they do need to access
the relevant search params.

One caveat is that the stock `useSearchParams{:ts}` hook from those frameworks doesn't
reflect shallow-updated search params, so we provide you with one that does:

```tsx
import { useOptimisticSearchParams } from 'nuqs/adapters/remix' // or '…/react-router/v6' or '…/react-router/v7'

function Component() {
  // Note: this is read-only, but reactive to all URL changes
  const searchParams = useOptimisticSearchParams()
  return <div>{searchParams.get('foo')}</div>
}
```

This concept of _"shallow routing"_ is done via updates to the browser's
[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API).

<Callout title="Why not using shouldRevalidate?">
 [`shouldRevalidate`](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/route-module#shouldrevalidate)
 is the idomatic way of opting out of running loaders on navigation, but nuqs uses
 the opposite approach: opting in to running loaders only when needed.

 In order to avoid specifying `shouldRevalidate` for every route, nuqs chose to
 patch the history methods to enable shallow routing by default (on its own updates)
 in React Router based frameworks.
</Callout>

## Scroll

The Next.js router scrolls to the top of the page on navigation updates,
which may not be desirable when updating the query string with local state.

Query state updates won't scroll to the top of the page by default, but you
can opt-in to this behaviour:

```ts
// [!code word:scroll]
useQueryState('foo', { scroll: true })
```


## Rate-limiting URL updates

Because of browsers rate-limiting the History API, updates **to the
URL** are queued and throttled to a default of 50ms, which seems to satisfy
most browsers even when sending high-frequency query updates, like binding
to a text input or a slider.

Safari's rate limits are much higher and use a default throttle of 120ms
(320ms for older versions of Safari).

<Callout title="Note">
the state returned by the hook is always updated **instantly**, to keep UI responsive.
Only changes to the URL, and server requests when using `shallow: false{:ts}`, are throttled or debounced.
</Callout>

This [throttle](#throttle) time is configurable, and also allows you to [debounce](#debounce) updates
instead.

<Callout title="Which one should I use?">
Throttle will emit the first update immediately, then batch updates at a slower
pace **regularly**. This is recommended for most low-frequency updates.

Debounce will push back the moment when the URL is updated when you set your state,
making it **eventually consistent**. This is recommended for high-frequency
updates where the last value is more interesting than the intermediate ones,
like a search input or moving a slider.

</Callout>

### Throttle

If you want to increase the throttle time -- for example to reduce the amount
of requests sent to the server when paired with `shallow: false{:ts}` -- you can
specify it under the `limitUrlUpdates{:ts}` option:

```ts
// [!code word:limitUrlUpdates]
useQueryState('foo', {
  // Send updates to the server maximum once every second
  shallow: false,
  limitUrlUpdates: {
    method: 'throttle',
    timeMs: 1000
  }
})

// or using the shorthand:
import { throttle } from 'nuqs'

useQueryState('foo', {
  shallow: false,
  limitUrlUpdates: throttle(1000)
})
```

If multiple hooks set different throttle values on the same event loop tick,
the highest value will be used. Also, values lower than 50ms will be ignored,
to avoid rate-limiting issues.
[Read more](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2023/storing-react-state-in-the-url-with-nextjs#batching--throttling).

Specifying a `+Infinity{:ts}` value for throttle time will **disable** updates to the
URL or the server, but all `useQueryState(s){:ts}` hooks will still update their
internal state and stay in sync with each other.

<Callout title="Deprecation notice">
The `throttleMs{:ts}` option has been deprecated in `nuqs@2.5.0` and will be removed
in a later major upgrade.

To migrate:
1. `import { throttle } from 'nuqs' {:ts}`
2.  Replace `{ throttleMs: 100 }{:ts}` with `{ limitUrlUpdates: throttle(100) }{:ts}` in your options.
</Callout>

### Debounce

<Callout type="warning" title="Do I need debounce?">
  Debounce only makes sense for **server-side data fetching** (RSCs & loaders, when combined with [`shallow: false{:ts}`](#shallow)),
  to control when requests are made to the server. For example: it lets you avoid sending the first
  character on its own when typing in a search input, by waiting for the user to finish typing.

  If you are **fetching client-side** (eg: with TanStack Query), you'll want to debounce the
  state returned by the hooks instead (using a 3rd party `useDebounce` utility hook).
</Callout>

In addition to throttling, you can apply a debouncing mechanism to URL updates,
to delay the moment where the URL gets updated with the latest value.

<Callout>
  The returned state is always updated **immediately**: only the network requests
  sent to the server are debounced.
</Callout>

This can be useful for high frequency state updates where the server only cares about
the final value, not all the intermediary ones while typing in a search input
or moving a slider.

We recommend you opt-in to debouncing on specific state updates, rather than
defining it for the whole search param.

Let's take the example of a search input. You'll want to update it:

1. When the user is typing text, with debouncing
2. When the user clears the input, by sending an immediate update
3. When the user presses Enter, by sending an immediate update

You can see the debounce case is the outlier here, and actually conditioned on
the set value, so we can specify it using the state updater function:

```tsx
// [!code word:debounce:1]
import { useQueryState, parseAsString, debounce } from 'nuqs';

function Search() {
  const [search, setSearch] = useQueryState(
    'q',
    parseAsString
      .withDefault('')
      .withOptions({ shallow: false })
  )

  return (
    <input
      value={search}
      onChange={(e) =>
        setSearch(e.target.value, {
          // Send immediate update if resetting, otherwise debounce at 500ms
          // [!code word:debounce:1]
          limitUrlUpdates: e.target.value === '' ? undefined : debounce(500)
        })
      }
      onKeyPress={(e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter') {
          // Send immediate update
          setSearch(e.target.value)
        }
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### Resetting

You can use the `defaultRateLimit{:ts}` import to reset debouncing or throttling to
the default:

```ts
// [!code word:defaultRateLimit]
import { debounce, defaultRateLimit } from 'nuqs'

const [, setState] = useQueryState('foo', {
  limitUrlUpdates: debounce(1000)
})

// This state update isn't debounced
setState('bar', { limitUrlUpdates: defaultRateLimit })
```


## Transitions

When combined with `shallow: false{:ts}`, you can use React's `useTransition{:ts}` hook
to get loading states while the server is re-rendering server components with
the updated URL.

Pass in the `startTransition{:ts}` function from `useTransition{:ts}` to the options
to enable this behaviour:

```tsx
'use client'

import React from 'react'
import { useQueryState, parseAsString } from 'nuqs'

function ClientComponent({ data }) {
  // 1. Provide your own useTransition hook:
  // [!code word:startTransition:1]
  const [isLoading, startTransition] = React.useTransition()
  const [query, setQuery] = useQueryState(
    'query',
    // 2. Pass the `startTransition` as an option:
    // [!code word:startTransition:1]
    parseAsString.withOptions({ startTransition, shallow: false })
  )
  // 3. `isLoading` will be true while the server is re-rendering
  // and streaming RSC payloads, when the query is updated via `setQuery`.

  // Indicate loading state
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>

  // Normal rendering with data
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

<Callout>
  In `nuqs@1.x.x`, passing `startTransition{:ts}` as an option automatically sets
  `shallow: false{:ts}`.

  This is no longer the case in `nuqs@>=2.0.0`: you'll need to set it explicitly.
</Callout>

## Clear on default

When the state is set to the default value, the search parameter is
removed from the URL, instead of being reflected explicitly.

However, sometimes you might want to keep the search parameter in the URL,
because **default values _can_ change**, and the meaning of the URL along with it.

<Callout title="Example of defaults changing">
  In `nuqs@1.x.x`, `clearOnDefault{:ts}` was `false{:ts}` by default.<br/>
  in `nuqs@2.0.0`, `clearOnDefault{:ts}` is now `true{:ts}` by default, in response
  to [user feedback](https://x.com/fortysevenfx/status/1841610237540696261).
</Callout>

If you want to keep the search parameter in the URL when it's set to the default
value, you can set `clearOnDefault{:ts}` to `false{:ts}`:

```ts
// [!code word:clearOnDefault]
useQueryState('search', {
  defaultValue: '',
  clearOnDefault: false
})
```

<Callout title="Tip">
  Clearing the key-value pair from the query string can always be done by setting the state to `null{:ts}`.
</Callout>

This option compares the set state against the default value using `==={:ts}`
reference equality, so if you are using a [custom parser](./parsers/making-your-own)
for a state type that wouldn't work with reference equality, you should provide
the `eq{:ts}` function to your parser (this is done for you in built-in parsers):

```ts
const dateParser = createParser({
  parse: (value: string) => new Date(value.slice(0, 10)),
  serialize: (date: Date) => date.toISOString().slice(0, 10),
  eq: (a: Date, b: Date) => a.getTime() === b.getTime() // [!code highlight]
})
```
