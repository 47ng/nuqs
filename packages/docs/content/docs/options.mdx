description: Configuring nuqs
---

By default, `nuqs` will update search params:
1. On the client only (not sending requests to the server),
2. by replacing the current history entry,
3. and without scrolling to the top of the page.

These behaviours can be configured, along with a few additional options.


## Providing options

Options can be passed at the hook level via the builder pattern:

```ts /withOptions/
const [state, setState] = useQueryState(
  'foo',
  parseAsString.withOptions({ history: 'push' })
)
```

Or when calling the state updater function, as a second parameter:

```ts /{ scroll: true }/
setState('foo', { scroll: true })
```

Call-level options will override hook level options.


## History

By default, state updates are done by replacing the current history entry with
the updated query when state changes.

You can see this as a sort of `git squash{:shell}`, where all state-changing
operations are merged into a single history value.

You can also opt-in to push a new history item for each state change,
per key, which will let you use the Back button to navigate state
updates:

```ts /history: 'replace'/ /history: 'push'/
// Default: replace current history with new state
useQueryState('foo', { history: 'replace' })

// Append state changes to history:
useQueryState('foo', { history: 'push' })
```

<Callout title="Watch out!" type="warn">
Breaking the Back button can lead to a bad UX, make sure to use this option
only if the search param(s) to update contribute to a navigation-like experience,
where hacking the Back button is a UX enhancement rather than a nuisance.

</Callout>

## Shallow

By default, query state updates are done in a _client-first_ manner: there are
no network calls to the server.

This is equivalent to the `shallow` option of the Next.js router set to `true{:ts}`.

To opt-in to query updates notifying the server (to re-run `getServerSideProps`
in the pages router and re-render Server Components on the app router),
you can set `shallow` to `false{:ts}`:

```ts /shallow: false/
useQueryState('foo', { shallow: false })
```


## Scroll

The Next.js router scrolls to the top of the page on navigation updates,
which may not be desirable when updating the query string with local state.

Query state updates won't scroll to the top of the page by default, but you
can opt-in to this behaviour:

```ts /scroll: true/
useQueryState('foo', { scroll: true })
```


## Throttling URL updates

Because of browsers rate-limiting the History API, updates **to the
URL** are queued and throttled to a default of 50ms, which seems to satisfy
most browsers even when sending high-frequency query updates, like binding
to a text input or a slider.

Safari's rate limits are much higher and require a throttle of 120ms (320ms for older
versions of Safari).

If you want to opt-in to a larger throttle time -- for example to reduce the amount
of requests sent to the server when paired with `shallow: false{:ts}` -- you can
specify it under the `throttleMs` option:

```ts /throttleMs: 1000/
useQueryState('foo', {
  // Send updates to the server maximum once every second
  shallow: false,
  throttleMs: 1000
})
```

> Note: the state returned by the hook is always updated **instantly**, to keep UI responsive.
> Only changes to the URL, and server requests when using `shallow: false`, are throttled.

If multiple hooks set different throttle values on the same event loop tick,
the highest value will be used. Also, values lower than 50ms will be ignored,
to avoid rate-limiting issues.

Specifying a `+Infinity{:ts}` value for `throttleMs` will **disable** updates to the
URL or the server, which means `useQueryState` will behave essentially like
`React.useState`.


## Transitions

When combined with `shallow: false{:ts}`, you can use React's `useTransition` hook
to get loading states while the server is re-rendering server components with
the updated URL.

Pass in the `startTransition` function from `useTransition` to the options
to enable this behaviour _(this will set `shallow: false{:ts}` automatically for you)_:

<Callout title="Upcoming changes" type="warn">
  In `nuqs@2.0.0`, passing `startTransition` will no longer automatically set `shallow: false{:ts}`.
</Callout>

```tsx /startTransition/1,3#2
'use client'

import React from 'react'
import { useQueryState, parseAsString } from 'nuqs'

function ClientComponent({ data }) {
  // 1. Provide your own useTransition hook:
  const [isLoading, startTransition] = React.useTransition()
  const [query, setQuery] = useQueryState(
    'query',
    // 2. Pass the `startTransition` as an option:
    parseAsString().withOptions({ startTransition })
  )
  // 3. `isLoading` will be true while the server is re-rendering
  // and streaming RSC payloads, when the query is updated via `setQuery`.

  // Indicate loading state
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>

  // Normal rendering with data
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

## Clear on default

By default, when the state is set to the default value, the search parameter is
**not** removed from the URL, and is reflected explicitly. This is because
**default values _can_ change**, and the meaning of the URL along with it.

<Callout title="Upcoming changes" type="warn">
  In `nuqs@2.0.0`, clearOnDefault will be set to `true{:ts}` by default, in response
  to [user feedback](https://x.com/fortysevenfx/status/1841610237540696261).
</Callout>

If you want to remove the search parameter from the URL when it's set to the default
value, you can set `clearOnDefault` to `true{:ts}`:

```ts /clearOnDefault: true/
useQueryState('search', {
  defaultValue: '',
  clearOnDefault: true
})
```

<Callout title="Tip">
  Clearing the key-value pair from the query string can always be done by setting the state to `null{:ts}`.
</Callout>

This option compares the set state against the default value using `===` reference
equality, so if you are using a [custom parser](./parsers#making-your-own-parsers)
for a state type that wouldn't work with reference equality, you should provide
the `eq` function to your parser (this is done for you in built-in parsers):

```ts
const dateParser = createParser({
  parse: (value: string) => new Date(value.slice(0, 10)),
  serialize: (date: Date) => date.toISOString().slice(0, 10),
  eq: (a: Date, b: Date) => a.getTime() === b.getTime()
})
```
