description: How to update your code to use nuqs@2.0.0
---

Here's a summary of the breaking changes in `nuqs@2.0.0`:

- [Enable support for other React frameworks](#adapters)
- [Behaviour changes](#behaviour-changes)
- [ESM-only package](#esm-only)
- [Deprecated exports have been removed](#deprecated-exports)
- [Renamed `nuqs/parsers` to `nuqs/server`](#renamed-nuqsparsers-to-nuqsserver)
- [Debug printout detection](#debug-printout-detection)

## Adapters

The biggest change is that `nuqs@2.0.0` now supports other React frameworks,
providing type-safe URL state for all.

You will need to wrap your app with the appropriate **adapter** for your framework,
to let the hooks know how to interact with its router.

Adapters are currently available for:
- Next.js (app & pages routers)
- React SPA
- Remix
- React Router
- Testing environments (Vitest, Jest, etc.)

If you are coming from nuqs v1 (which only supported Next.js), you'll need to
wrap your app with the appropriate `NuqsAdapter`:

### Next.js

<Callout title="Minimum required version: next@>=14.2.0">

Early versions of Next.js 14 were in flux with regards to shallow routing.
Supporting those earlier versions required a lot of hacks, workarounds, and
performance penalties, which were removed in `nuqs@2.0.0`.

</Callout>

#### App router

```tsx {1} /NuqsAdapter/ title="src/app/layout.tsx"
import { NuqsAdapter } from 'nuqs/adapters/next/app'
import { type ReactNode } from 'react'

export default function RootLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <NuqsAdapter>{children}</NuqsAdapter>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

#### Pages router

```tsx {2} /NuqsAdapter/ title="src/pages/_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { NuqsAdapter } from 'nuqs/adapters/next/pages'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <NuqsAdapter>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </NuqsAdapter>
  )
}
```

#### Unified (router-agnostic)

If your Next.js app uses **both the app and pages routers** and the adapter needs
to be mounted in either, you can use the unified adapter, at the cost
of a slightly larger bundle size (~100B).

```tsx
import { NuqsAdapter } from 'nuqs/adapters/next'
```

### Other adapters

Albeit not part of a migration from v1, you can now use nuqs in other React
frameworks via their respective [adapters](https://nuqs.47ng.com/docs/adapters).

{/* todo: Add the docs/adapters page */}

However, there's one more adapter that might be of interest to you, and solves
a long-standing issue with testing components using nuqs hooks:

### Testing adapter

Until now, unit-testing nuqs components was a hassle, as it required mocking
Next.js internals, causing abstraction leaks.

You can now wrap your components to test with the `NuqsTestingAdapter`, which
provides setup & assertion helpers for your tests.

Here's an example with Vitest & Testing Library:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { NuqsTestingAdapter, type UrlUpdateEvent } from 'nuqs/adapters/testing'
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import { CounterButton } from './counter-button'

it('should increment the count when clicked', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  const onUrlUpdate = vi.fn<[UrlUpdateEvent]>()
  render(<CounterButton />, {
    // Setup the test by passing initial search params / querystring:
    wrapper: ({ children }) => (
      <NuqsTestingAdapter searchParams="?count=1" onUrlUpdate={onUrlUpdate}>
        {children}
      </NuqsTestingAdapter>
    )
  })
  // Act
  const button = screen.getByRole('button')
  await user.click(button)
  // Assert changes in the state and in the (mocked) URL
  expect(button).toHaveTextContent('count is 2')
  expect(onUrlUpdate).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].queryString).toBe('?count=2')
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].searchParams.get('count')).toBe('2')
  expect(onUrlUpdate.mock.calls[0][0].options.history).toBe('push')
})
```

## Behaviour changes

Setting `startTransition` no longer sets `shallow: false` automatically.
In Next.js, you'll have to specify both to get a loading state.
This is to align with other frameworks that don't have a concept of shallow
(or deep) routing.

As a consequence, the `Options` type is no longer generic.

The `"use client"` directive was not included in the client import
(`import {} from 'nuqs'`). It has now been added, meaning that server-side code
needs to import from `nuqs/server` to avoid errors like:

```
Error: Attempted to call withDefault() from the server but withDefault is on
the client. It's not possible to invoke a client function from the server, it can
only be rendered as a Component or passed to props of a Client
Component.
```

## ESM only

`nuqs@2.0.0` is now an [ESM-only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
package. This should not be much of an issue since Next.js supports ESM in
app code since version 12, but if you are bundling `nuqs` code into an
intermediate CJS library to be consumed in Next.js, you'll run into import issues:

```txt
[ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module not supported
```

If converting your library to ESM is not possible, your main option is to
dynamically import `nuqs`:

```ts
const { useQueryState } = await import('nuqs')
```

## Deprecated exports

Some of the v1 API was marked as deprecated back in September 2023, and has been
removed in `nuqs@2.0.0`.

### `queryTypes` parsers object

The `queryTypes` object has been removed in favor of individual parser exports,
for better tree-shaking.

Replace with `parseAsXYZ` to match:

```diff
- import { queryTypes } from 'nuqs'
+ import { parseAsString, parseAsInteger, ... } from 'nuqs'

- useQueryState('q',    queryTypes.string.withOptions({ ... }))
- useQueryState('page', queryTypes.integer.withDefault(1))
+ useQueryState('q',    parseAsString.withOptions({ ... }))
+ useQueryState('page', parseAsInteger.withDefault(1))
```

### `subscribeToQueryUpdates`

Next.js 14.1.0 makes `useSearchParams` reactive to shallow search params updates,
which makes this internal helper function redundant. See #425 for context.

## Renamed `nuqs/parsers` to `nuqs/server`

When introducing the server cache in #387, the dedicated export for parsers was
reused as it didn't include the `"use client"` directive. Since it now contains
more than parsers and probably will be extended with server-only code in the future,
it has been renamed to a clearer export name.

Find and replace all occurrences of `nuqs/parsers` to `nuqs/server` in your code:

```diff
- import { parseAsInteger, createSearchParamsCache } from 'nuqs/parsers'
+ import { parseAsInteger, createSearchParamsCache } from 'nuqs/server'
```

## Debug printout detection

After the rename to `nuqs`, the debugging printout detection logic handled either
`next-usequerystate` or `nuqs` being present in the `localStorage.debug` variable.
`nuqs@2.0.0` only checks for the presence of the `nuqs` substring to enable logs.

Update your local dev environments to match by running this once in the devtools console:

```ts
if (localStorage.debug) {
  localStorage.debug = localStorage.debug.replace('next-usequerystate', 'nuqs')
}
```
