description: Store your table state in the URL, with style.

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table) is a popular library for managing
tabular content in React (and other frameworks).

By default, it will store its state in memory, losing all filters, sorts and
pagination when the page is refreshed. This is a prime example where URL state
shines.

## Pagination

TanStack Table stores pagination under two pieces of state:

- `pageIndex`: a zero-based integer representing the current page
- `pageSize`: an integer representing the number of items per page

You will likely want the URL to follow your UI and be one-based for the page index:

import {
  TanStackTablePagination,
  TanStackTableSorting,
  TanStackTableFiltering
} from './tanstack-table.generator'

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTablePagination />
</Suspense>

## Sorting

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTableSorting />
</Suspense>

## Filtering

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTableFiltering />
</Suspense>
