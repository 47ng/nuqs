description: Store your table state in the URL, with style.
---

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table) is a popular library for managing
tabular content in React (and other frameworks).

By default, it will store its state in memory, losing all filters, sorts and
pagination when the page is refreshed. This is a prime example where URL state
shines.

## Pagination

TanStack Table stores pagination under two pieces of state:

- `pageIndex`: a zero-based integer representing the current page
- `pageSize`: an integer representing the number of items per page

You will likely want the URL to follow your UI and be one-based for the page index:

import { TanStackTablePagination } from './tanstack-table.pagination'

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTablePagination />
</Suspense>

## Column Filtering

TanStack Table stores filtering under a single piece of state:

- `columnFilters`: an array of `ColumnFilter` objects with the following shape:

  ```ts
  type ColumnFilter = {
    id: string
    value: unknown
  }
  ```

Column filters are managed by specifying the column ID and value in the URL as `columnId=value`.

<Callout title="Note">
  Value is serialized to a JSON string, so you can use any valid JSON value.
</Callout>

import { TanStackTableColumnFiltering } from './tanstack-table.column-filtering'

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTableColumnFiltering />
</Suspense>

## Sorting

TanStack Table stores sorting under a single piece of state:

- `sorting`: an array of `ColumnSort` objects with the following shape:

  ```ts
  type ColumnSort = {
    id: string
    desc: boolean
  }
  ```

Sorting is managed by specifying the column ID and direction in the URL as `columnId:direction`.

<Callout title="Tip">
  Hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while clicking column headers to sort by
  multiple columns simultaneously.
</Callout>

import { TanStackTableSorting } from './tanstack-table.sorting'

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTableSorting />
</Suspense>

## Kitchen Sink

This example demonstrates a fully-featured TanStack Table integration with Nuqs,
including column filtering, sorting, and pagination - all persisted in the URL.
The table's internal state is displayed below to show how the URL parameters sync with the table state.

import { TanStackTableKitchenSink } from './tanstack-table.kitchen-sink'

<Suspense>
  <TanStackTableKitchenSink />
</Suspense>
