description: Integrate nuqs with Inertia
---

[Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) is supported as a community-contributed adapter.

<Callout title="Try it out">
Check out the [demo app](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs-inertia-pingcrm)
which is a fork of Inertia's Ping CRM demo with nuqs.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Add the adapter code

<Callout type="warn">
  The custom adapters APIs are not yet stable and may change in the future in a
  minor or patch release (not following SemVer).
</Callout>

import { InertiaAdapterSource } from './inertia-adapter-source'

<InertiaAdapterSource/>

## Step 2: Create a new global app layout

Integrate the adapter into the root layout file, by wrapping it around the children
of the layout component:

```tsx title="resources/js/Layouts/AppLayout.tsx" /NuqsAdapter/
import { NuqsAdapter } from '.@/lib/nuqs-inertia-adapter'
import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'

export default function Layout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return <NuqsAdapter>{children}</NuqsAdapter>
}
```
