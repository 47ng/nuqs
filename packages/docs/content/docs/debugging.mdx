description: Enabling debug logs and user timings markers
---

You can enable debug logs in the browser by setting the `debug` item in localStorage
to `nuqs`, and reload the page.

```js
// In your devtools:
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'nuqs')
```

> Note: unlike the `debug` package, this will not work with wildcards, but
> you can combine it: `localStorage.setItem('debug', '*,nuqs')`

Log lines will be prefixed with `[nuqs]` for `useQueryState` and `[nuq+]` for
`useQueryStates`, along with other internal debug logs.

User timings markers are also recorded, for advanced performance analysis using
your browser's devtools.

Providing debug logs when opening an [issue](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs/issues)
is always appreciated. 🙏
