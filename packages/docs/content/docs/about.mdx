## About the name

`nuqs` was originally called `next-usequerystate`. The old name was too long
and annoying to type.

### How is it pronounced?

Up to you. I say "nukes". _`[njuks]`_

### What does it mean?

It's the initials of the original name, `Next-UseQueryState`.

I realised after the fact that the word `nuqs` is Urdu for "flaw" or "defect".
It's a good reminder that:

I probably should have checked the meaning of the word before using it,
and apologise to any Urdu-speaking user who might find it offensive.
