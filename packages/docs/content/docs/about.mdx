## About the name

### How is it pronounced?

Up to you. I say "nucks" (like ducks 🦆🦆).


### What does nuqs mean?

> **Never underestimate query strings**.

Kidding aside, it's the initials of the original name package name, `Next-UseQueryState`,
which was too long and annoying to type.

I realised after the fact that the word `nuqs` in Urdu & Arabic means "flaw" or "defect".
It's a good reminder that:

I probably should have checked the meaning of the word before using it,
and apologise to any Urdu/Arabic-speaking user who might find it offensive.

It's also Klingon for "What?!", the kind of reaction you get when you
move from `useState{:ts}` to URL state for the first time. 🖖
