description: Some tips on testing components that use `nuqs`
---

Currently, the best way to test the behaviour of your components using
`useQueryState(s)` is end-to-end testing, with tools like Playwright or Cypress.

Running components that use the Next.js router in isolation requires mocking it,
which is being [worked on](https://github.com/scottrippey/next-router-mock/pull/103)
for the app router.

See issue [#259](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs/issues/259) for more testing-related discussions.
