## URL update throttling

Browsers rate-limit the History API, updates to the URL are queued and throttled to a default of 50ms, which seems to satisfy most browsers even when sending high-frequency query updates, like binding to a text input or a slider.

Safariâ€™s rate limits are much higher and require a throttle of 120ms (320ms for older versions of Safari).

Nuqs handles this out of the box so you don't run into those rate-limits, however it is possible to set your own custom throttles.

For more info how to set custom throttles see [Throttling URL updates](/docs/options#throttling-url-updates).

## Max URL lengths

Most modern browsers enforce a max URL length, which can vary:

- **Chrome:** ~2 MB (practically, you might encounter issues at around 2,000 characters).
- **Firefox:** ~65,000 characters.
- **Safari:** Generally has more restrictive limits (around 80,000 characters).
- **IE/Edge:** Historically limited to 2,083 characters (IE), although Edge has relaxed this limit.

Additionally, transport mechanisms like social media, messaging apps, and emails may impose significantly lower limits on URL length. Long URLs may be truncated, wrapped, or rendered unusable when shared on these platforms.

Keep in mind that not all application state should be stored in URLs. Exceeding the 2,000-character range may indicate the need to reconsider your state management approach.
