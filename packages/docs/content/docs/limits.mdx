## URL update throttling

Browsers rate-limit the History API, updates to the URL are queued and throttled to a default of 50ms, which seems to satisfy most browsers even when sending high-frequency query updates, like binding to a text input or a slider.

Safariâ€™s rate limits are much higher and require a throttle of 120ms (320ms for older versions of Safari).

For more info how to set custom trottles see [Throttling URL updates](./options#throttling-url-updates)

## Max URL lengths

Most modern browsers enforce a max URL length, which can vary:

- **Chrome:** ~2 MB (practically, you might encounter issues at around 2,000 characters).
- **Firefox:** ~65,000 characters.
- **Safari:** Generally has more restrictive limits (around 8,000 characters).
- **IE/Edge:** Historically limited to 2,083 characters (IE), although Edge has relaxed this limit.

Not all state belongs into URLs. If you exceed the 2,000 character limit you are probably not correctly architecting your state.
