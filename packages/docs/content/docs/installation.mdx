## What happened to `next-usequerystate`?

It was a mouthful to type, so I decided to abbreviate it to `nuqs`
(pronounced however you like, I say "nukes").

The `nuqs` name was introduced in 1.14.0, and `next-usequerystate` will mirror
its versions for the rest of the 1.x.x range. The next major version update
(2.0.0) and subsequent versions will only be published under the `nuqs` name.
